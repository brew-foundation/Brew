On the **19th of April,** private testing for Brew opened to a select few users. After a considerable amount of feedback
from testing, we are pleased to announce a few major things happening soon!

<!-- truncate -->

Private testing of version, **0.1.0** has ended thus marking the path towards the first official release which brings me
to the first headline...


## v0.1.0 Release
After a considerable amount of feedback from testing, we are excited to announce the release date will be on **May 20, 2024.**

## New developer API coming soon
We're also announcing a new API which will allow for developers to build applications and systems that works with Brew
Services. Separate from the project, this would set the foundation for more API features within Brew itself. Release date
TBA.

## Website!
Brew also now has a website separate from Brew Services which will give documentation and will act as the home of Brew.

We have more features cooking and we commited to creating an application built ontop of FOSS libraries, frameworks, and 
services. Thank you for those who helped with the development cycle!
